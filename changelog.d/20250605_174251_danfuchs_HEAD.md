### New features

- Serve multiple datasets out of different GCS buckets from a new api/hips/v2/<dataset> series of endpoints. The existing api/hips endpoints will still work, given that a default dataset is specified in the config.

  This assumes:

    - All buckets will be in the same GCP project
    - The Google service account that is federated with the running crawlspace pods have access to the buckets
    - There are no datasets with v2/ files that we want to serve
