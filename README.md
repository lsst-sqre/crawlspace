crawlspace is a tiny static file server backed by [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage).
This file server is currently used to serve a [HiPS](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/HiPS/) file tree for Rubin Observatory.

crawlspace is developed with the [Safir](https://safir.lsst.io) framework.
[Get started with development with the tutorial](https://safir.lsst.io/set-up-from-template.html).
